# Final Project for the Network Science course (Spring 2021)
## Dataset
The dataset for this analysis consists of two main subsets:

1. The dataset of bills, their textual and lobbying information. Link to the dataset: [dataset.pickle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVrSyMd5n3R8w8BHaqXAQkc5pAG0BCTU/view?usp=sharing). The dataset is already partially processed. Otherwise, there would be tons of elements that need too much space to store.

2. The dataset of additional information about the bills: [Link to the library to scrape the data](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress/wiki/bills). There are more than 100k jsons for the dataset, so I won't be able to include them in my drive. If you are interested in this data, the guideline is very simple, so you can use it yourself to scrape this data.
